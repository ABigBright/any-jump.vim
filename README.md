# any-jump

**â€” IDE madness without overhead for 40+ languages**

_Nvim plugin for "jump to defitinitionâš’" and "find usagesðŸ”¬" feature through nice popup ui_

Based on syntax rules for 40 languages and **fast regexp engines** like ripgrep and ag. Required `rg` or `ag` to be installed. GNU grep support dropped for flavor of blazing perfomance (can be implemented in future releases).
